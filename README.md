# bdomarketdata
* This is an experimental project that uses linear regression to predict item prices in the MMO Black Desert Online.
* The BDO API doesn't provide enough information on item data in the past, so I'm currently bottlenecked by the amount of data
* Market item prices are almost impossible to predict because of new patches and updates that impact market prices
